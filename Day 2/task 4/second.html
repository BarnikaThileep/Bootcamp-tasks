            Impressionism
        </h1>
        <p>Impressionism began in the late 19th century as a radical departure from traditional art techniques. Artists like Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir focused on capturing light, movement, and the passage of time rather than fine details. Their works, often painted en plein air, prioritized spontaneity and atmospheric effects. Short brushstrokes and vibrant colors were key in creating a sense of immediacy. Viewers saw a fresh perspective that blurred outlines and embraced the fleeting nature of moments. Impressionism ultimately reshaped the way people viewed landscape and portrait painting.</p>

            Cubbisim
        </h2>
        <p>Cubism, pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, shattered conventional ideas of perspective in art. Instead of showing objects from a single angle, Cubist artists depicted multiple viewpoints simultaneously. The movement fragmented subjects into geometric shapes, offering a new and abstract way to view reality. This break from realism challenged the boundaries of visual representation. Both Analytic and Synthetic Cubism pushed the boundaries further, blending objects with their surroundings. As a result, Cubism became a fundamental influence in 20th-century modern art.</p>
         <h3>
            Surrealism
         </h3>
         <p>Surrealism emerged in the 1920s, rooted in the belief that the unconscious mind holds untapped creative potential. Artists like Salvador Dalí and René Magritte produced dreamlike, often bizarre imagery, attempting to merge reality with the subconscious. They aimed to challenge the limitations of rational thought and explore the strange and unexpected. Automatic drawing, a key technique, allowed artists to create without conscious control. This movement wasn’t limited to visual arts but also deeply influenced literature and film. Surrealism left an indelible mark on how creativity interacts with the human psyche.</p>
